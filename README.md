with Carigo you can plan and book everything in your trip from activites near your destination to your plane tickets in one place!!

## Build Status
this project is still under development and not publishable to the public

## Code Style
the project is split among 2 folder
1. **frontned**
    this folder has everything related to the clients side and is split into
    - **components:** folder with most of the website front end componentns
    - **Pages:** folder that has all the .js files that are full pages on the website
        - some folders inside the pages folder have a sub components folder that has components specific to these folders
    - **assets :** this folder is used to hold any images used inside our frontend
2. **backend**
    this is where the server side is handled and it si split into a few main folders
    - **controllers :** this has the controllers for all the main elements of our project and where all the code for the API functions is written
    - **routes :** the folder that handles creating routes for all API functions created inside controllers
    - **models :** contains the database models for all pur database elements 
    - **middleware:** used to hold the code for anu authentication procees required
    - **public/img :** a folder used to hold all the uploaded images / documents for admin approval
    - **utils :**  contains functions that help controllers in things such as error checking and sending emails
    3. **We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)** to enforce a consistent code style.

## Frameworks-used
#### MERN stack
- **MonogDB:** MongoDB is used to host our server.
- **Express:** Express is used to interface our back and front ends. 
- **React:** React.js is used to build our website frontend.
- **Node:** Node.js is used as our backend runtime environment in Javascript. 
- **postman :** postman was used to test our routes before implementing them into frontend

#### Frontend Libraries 
- **Material UI (6.1.9):** we use mui as alot of its built in components are easier to use than HTML
- **joy :** to validate user inputs
- basic HTML components
- **jwt-decode**: to decode user token to get user id when needed
#### Backend Libraries 
- **bcrypt:** was used for hashing and unhashing of passwords and authentication perposes
- **dotenv:** to get data for the .env file to avoid exposing private keys
- **node-schedule**: was used for tasks that need scheduling like checking daily for birhdays and notifications
- **nodemon**: in order to recompile the code each time a modification was made
#### User Communication 
- **nodeMailer**: was used to send emails
#### Payment 
- **stripe**: was used to handle card payments
- **exchangerate-api.com**: was user for currency conversion
#### HTTP client 
- **Axios**: to handle communication between frotend and backend

   3. Select the HTTP method for the request: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. 
   4. Enter the endpoint URL in the address bar. 
   5. Optional: If the endpoint requires any query parameters or request body, add them in the corresponding sections. 
   5. Click the "Send" button to send the request. 
   6. Check the response status code and response body to ensure that the endpoint is functioning as expected. 
   7. Repeat the process for any additional endpoints you want to test. 
  
   ###### **Note:** Some endpoints may require authentication or specific headers to be set in the request. Make sure to configure these accordingly in Postman before sending the request. 

## How to Use
##### first use the command
    npm i dotenv
##### then create a .env file in the backend folder with the following code 
    PORT ="<the port number that you will run the backend on>"
    DATABASE ="<Your Mongo Connection String>"
    JWT_SECRET ="<Your Mongo Connection String>"
    JWT_EXPIRES_IN="<the time token will expire after. meaning that the user will auto signout after that time>"
    JWT_COOKIE_EXPIRES_IN="<the time the stored cookies will expire after. should be the same as "JWT_EXPIRES_IN">"
